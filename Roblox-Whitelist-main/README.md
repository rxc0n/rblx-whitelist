This is a Roblox Whitelist that uses MySql, NodeJS, PHP, Roblox Lua (LUAU).
How this works is the following:

(Whitelisting Part)
Discord Bot -> Website Server -> MySql

(Roblox Script Part)
Roblox -> Website -> Checks For UserID Inside -> Returns Value -> Then Your Script

It has the following features: No logs (at least for my http logger), clear console, and discord username to roblox account.

Enjoy!
